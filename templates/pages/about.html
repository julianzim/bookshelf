            One of Yassya's most significant discoveries in her practice is Fairy Tale Therapy. This method, based on magical stories and characters, allows children to explore their emotions safely and learn to manage them. Through stories, children learn empathy, problem-solving, and self-understanding. Fairy Tale Therapy helps young readers find harmony within their inner world and develop emotional resilience.
