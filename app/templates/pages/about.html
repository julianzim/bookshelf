                    <h2>Hello, everyone! I’m Yassya Lil, an author of children's illustrated books</h2>
                    <p>
                        My work is dedicated to one of the most important missions: helping children develop emotional intelligence. 
                        With a background in psychology and over 10 years of experience working with children, 
                        I know exactly how to guide young readers toward becoming emotionally literate and self-aware individuals.

                        I believe that emotional intelligence is fundamental to a child's healthy development. 
                        Children who understand and manage their emotions grow into happier, more confident, and successful individuals. 
                        They cope better with stress, build stronger relationships, and face life’s challenges with resilience. 
                        Every child deserves the chance to develop these essential skills, and my goal is to make this 
                        journey both engaging and accessible

                        One of the most important insights from my work is the concept of Fairy Tale Therapy — 
                        using magical stories and characters to help children explore their emotions in a safe and imaginative way. 
                        My illustrated books are designed to guide young readers on a journey of emotional growth, 
                        teaching them empathy, problem-solving, and self-awareness while building resilience and inner balance

                        My mission is to inspire thousands of children on their journey toward emotional awareness and self-acceptance. 
                        Through my books, I aim to create a world where children not only enjoy magical stories but also learn valuable 
                        lessons about feelings, relationships, and self-discovery. My goal is to help them build confidence, 
                        embrace their emotions, and create healthy, happy connections with others — one story at a time

                        With every new project, I continue to create magical worlds that support children’s emotional well-being.
