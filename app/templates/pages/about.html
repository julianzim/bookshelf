                        Yassya Lil is a talented author of children's illustrated books, who has dedicated 
                        her life to one of the most important missions: developing children's emotional intelligence. 
                        With over 10 years of experience as a child psychologist and an educational background in psychology, 
                        Yassya knows exactly how to help children become emotionally literate and self-aware individuals.

                        Yassya's work has shown that emotional intelligence is fundamental to a child's healthy development. 
                        Children who understand and manage their emotions grow up to be happier, more confident, and successful individuals. 
                        They handle stress better, get along well with others, and build strong relationships. 
                        Yassya believes that every child deserves the opportunity to develop these crucial skills.

                    One of Yassya's most significant discoveries in her practice is Fairy Tale Therapy. 
                    This method, based on magical stories and characters, allows children to explore their emotions safely and learn to manage them. 
                    Through stories, children learn empathy, problem-solving, and self-understanding. 
                    Fairy Tale Therapy helps young readers find harmony within their inner world and develop emotional resilience.
